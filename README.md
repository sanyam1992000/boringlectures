## Backend

* #### Django 
    Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source.
    
    * ###### Why Django ?
        *  Ridiculously fast
        *  Reassuringly secure
        *  Exceedingly scalable
        *  Incredibly versatile
        *  Easy to Integrate with Python Libraries/Functions
        
    
* #### Celery - Redis
    ‚ÄúCelery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.‚Äù
    * ###### Why is this useful ?
        * Think of all the times you have had to run a certain task in the future. Perhaps you needed to access an API every hour. Or maybe you needed to send a batch of emails at the end of the day. Large or small, Celery makes scheduling such periodic tasks easy.
        
        * You never want end users to have to wait unnecessarily for pages to load or actions to complete. If a long process is part of your application‚Äôs workflow, you can use Celery to execute that process in the background, as resources become available, so that your application can continue to respond to client requests. This keeps the task out of the application‚Äôs context.
